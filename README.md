## üåü Overview

**Warracker** is a web-based application designed to simplify and centralize product warranty management.

### üë®‚Äçüîß Why I Built This

Warracker was born out of a frustrating and all-too-common experience: dealing with warranties.

My father once called me for help with his broken dishwasher. We were confident it was still under warranty, especially since we had the invoice. But after countless back-and-forth with the manufacturer, they insisted it wasn‚Äôt covered due to a mismatch in the serial number. The truth? My father had unknowingly purchased **two** dishwashers, and we were referencing the wrong one.

This wasn‚Äôt my first time running into warranty headaches, and I realized there had to be a better way. That‚Äôs when I decided to build **Warracker**, a simple tool to track purchases, receipts, and warranty periods in one place. Since then, Warracker has already saved me money by alerting me before my **car‚Äôs warranty expired**, allowing me to make necessary repairs just in time.

Inspired by [**Wallos**](https://github.com/ellite/Wallos), an app I used to track subscriptions, I thought, *why not do the same for warranties?* Now I want to make it available to anyone who has faced similar frustration.

Thank you for your support as I continue to improve Warracker.
